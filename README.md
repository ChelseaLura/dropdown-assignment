First project built using React and Material-UI.
Purposefully uses stubbed fake data and doesn't have a real backend or redux setup

## TODO:
 - Finish needed functionality and sections
 - Add tests
 - Break up into smaller components
 - Use more variables in styles, setup style constants file
 - Make it look prettier, match mock-up more closely

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
