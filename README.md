First project built using React and Material-UI.
Purposefully uses stubbed fake data and doesn't have a real backend or uses any sort of Flux setup.
If I wasn't building this for an assignment to be as minimal as possible,
I'd setup a Flux store for sharing state across components.

## TODO:
 - Add tests
 - Break up larger components into smaller components
 - Use more variables in styles, setup style constants file
 - Make member drop down line up with input
 - Make member avatar photos overlap
 - Learn how to gain access input underline and placeholder styles to match mock-up
 - Learn how to change expandIcon styles when expanded=true
 - Once requested, add 'create team' functionality


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
